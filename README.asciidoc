SQI Test
========

== About

The SQI test is a test for the Quad SPI/SQI unit on netX SOCs.

Currently, only the netX 90 with Winbond W25Q32 flash is supported.

The test reads the JEDEC ID of the device in 1 bit SPI mode and checks it against the expected value. 
Then, it enables the 4 bit QPI mode, reads the ID again and compares it to the expected response, which is different in QPI mode.

The test is a netX console application. The Muhkuh test framework is used to download and execute it.
